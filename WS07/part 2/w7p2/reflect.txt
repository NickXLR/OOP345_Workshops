Date of Completion: 7-11-23

Authenticity Declaration:
 I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
***********************************************************************************************************************************/

All STL function used in this workshop:

for_each to display all Covids in the collection and to accumulate cases and deaths.
sort to sort the collection based on received criteria, like country.
any_of for function inCollection to indicate wheather there exists a country with a specified variant with more than the amount of deaths specified.
copy_if to copy from collection to a new list any covid statistic with more deaths than provided.
transform to change the severity in each Covid in the collection to the corresponding one depending on number of deaths.

If I wrote the loops myself I would have to come up with a lot more logic than exists, like sort, My code would also be a lot slower than the provided algorythms.

I would redesign it so that an unsigned integer is received in place of a string, such that for example, 
passing col.sort(0) would sort the collection based on the first member of Covid, which is country, if a number would be passed larger than number of member variable in Covid, 
I would throw an exception that such afield does not exist.
